# Storage Drive Adapter

This object is an adapter which allows to fit two 2.5" storage devices into one 3.5" drive bay.
The dimensions should conform to the relevant standards by the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA).
Another design goal was to allow for as much heat dissipation as possible by not covering the drives' surfaces and leaving a gap between both drives.
