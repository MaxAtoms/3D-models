# Handle for Blind Cranks

At my workplace most of the handles for the blind cranks broke over time.
Instead of starting a lenghty search for a replacement part, we decided to try whether a 3D printed part will be able to hold up for a reasonable amount of time.

Print settings:

- 4 perimeters
- 50% infill
- 0.2 mm layer height (higher values will negatively impact part strength, see: [CNC Kitchen Video](https://youtu.be/fbSQvJJjw2Q))
